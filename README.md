# Website-2.0
The second version of Kris' website, a demo of this version may be found <a href="http://k9101.github.io/Website-2.0/">here</a>. This version was live from June - December 2015, before being replaced by <a href="http://krispenney.me">version 2.5</a> in early 2016.

This version includes many new improvements over my previous website including:
  * An all new design!
  * Completely responsive
  * Integration with an Android app (Which I also developed!) to update the 'Where is Kris?' section
  * A live 'Progress Bar' showing my progress through out school
  * All content sections are loaded in via AJAX inside of a JSON file, to allow for simple content updates
  * And Many More...
